I've always been fascinated by computer vision, but the existing tools always felt like a compromise. You either pay exorbitant monthly fees for enterprise software, or you hand over your video feeds to a cloud server you don't control.

That didn't sit right with me. I wanted something that was powerful, looked good, and most importantly **ran entirely on my own device.**

So, I built **ZoneNet**.

[Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/Kongesque/zonenet)

## Why ZoneNet?

ZoneNet is an open-source project that brings professional-grade object counting and video analytics to **EVERYONE**. It's not just a script; it's a full-stack application designed to be easy to set up and even easier to use.

Under the hood, it’s combining the incredible speed of **YOLO11** with **ByteTrack** for tracking. But you don't need to be an ML engineer to use it. You just spin it up, connect a camera, and start gathering data.

## The "Cool" Stuff (Features)

### 🎨 Draw Your Own Zones
This is my favorite part. Every camera angle is unique, right? A reckless driver in a parking lot or a customer walking down a specific aisle—you can't capture that with a generic box.
ZoneNet lets you draw customizable **polygon zones** directly on the video feed. You can count exactly what happens in *that specific corner* of the frame.

### 🔒 Privacy by Default
I'm a huge believer in data privacy. With ZoneNet, **what happens on your network, stays on your network.**
There is no "cloud upload" feature. All processing happens locally on your CPU or GPU. Whether you're monitoring your home, a retail store, or a private facility, your footage never leaves your hardware.

### ⚡ Real-Time, For Real
We're using **Next.js 15** for the dashboard, and it feels *snappy*. You get instant feedback on tracking, current occupancy counts, and dwell times. It’s mesmerizing to watch the analytics update live as objects move through the frame.

## What Can You Actually Do With It?

I built this to be versatile. Here are a few improved ways people are using it:

*   **Retail Analytics:** analyzing which store displays get the most attention (dwell time).
*   **Smart Home:** counting how many cars pass by your driveway per hour.
*   **Safety:** creating "danger zones" around machinery that trigger alerts if someone steps inside.

## The Tech Stack

For my fellow developers, here is what makes it tick:

*   **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+)
*   **AI:** YOLO11, ByteTrack, OpenCV
*   **Infrastructure:** Fully Dockerized

## Give It a Spin

ZoneNet is open source and free. I'd love for you to try it out, break it, and tell me what you think.

Happy counting!
